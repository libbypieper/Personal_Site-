Personal website project part 1 

This project is a personal website project with three pages: a Home page introducing myself, an About page with info about my hobbies and interests, and a Portfolio page highlighting my work.  This project is to help me demonstrate and practice skills in HTML and CSS, including creating a nav bar, and is essentially a rough draft personal website.
