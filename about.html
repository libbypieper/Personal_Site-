        <p>
          Time in nature is important for my body and mind. Nature is where I
          can relax and unplug. I enjoy hiking in forest preserves or even just
          walking around my neighborhood. Movement outside is how I clear my
          head and find unexpected answers to problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although any time outside (especiallly where there's trees) can be a
          source of wonder, I've also explored nature in more adventourous
          places as well. I've hiked in Denali National Park in Alaska, Joshua
          Tree in California, and Saguaro National Park in Arizona.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hiking and walking in nature helps to improve mindfulness and provides
          a sense of wonder. It is a way for me to re-charge my batteries so
          that I can come back to the world of phones, screens, and people with
          new energy and focus.

        <p>
          Ever since I could crawl, I have had music in my life. I sat at a
          piano for the first time at age two, and began taking flute lessons at
          age ten.
        </p>
        <p>
          Music brings me inspirationa and a way to release and regulate
          emotions. It can reduce anxiety and give me the motivation to move my
          body. It boosts my soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though I do not perform music as much anymore, I seek out music
          performances whenever I can. I enjoy music festivals, live Dj's
          playing techno and house music in my hometown of Chicago, as well as
          rock, metal, and punk concerts at places like Riot Fest.

        <p>
          Travel is a hobby that has expanded my cultural awareness, sense of
          adventure, and curiosity. I have found that travel has given me a
          different perspective of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have had the privelege of travelling to twenty-nine countries and
          plan on travelling to many more. It has been difficult at times to
          make it happen and it has often not been glamorous.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the last few years I have traveled throughout much of Europe,
          including the Iberian Peninsula, Ireland, Scotland, and Scandinavia. I
          have witnessed the northern lights above the Arctic Circle, seen the
          Zen gardens of Kyoto, and the red city of Marrekesh.
